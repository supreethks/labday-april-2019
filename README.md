## Wishlist and roadmap
1. Build <iframe> like survey library to plugin in areas like after call, call log, popups
2. Self service dashboard to create surveys
3. Backend to segment, target users
4. Dashboard to showcase results

## Opportunities
1. We can use this system to collect qualitative feedback and data about our product and services. 
2. Once we build the backend segmentation data processing, app frontends and self survice front end, we can offer surveys as a type of advertisement. 
3. We can offer this to business profiles. In their profiles they can run surveys to collect user feedback. In aftercall they can have surveys about customer care calls etc.
